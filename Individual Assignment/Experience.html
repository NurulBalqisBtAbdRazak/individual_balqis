<h1> About My Experience</h1>

<h2>AS A UNIVERSITY STUDENT'S EXPERIENCE</h2>
<p> I started my student life in University when I was 18 years old which is 2 years ago.</p>
<p> At first, I think it must be hard for me since I have never been away from my parents for long time. And yes, for the first week at college, I always faced a homesick so I called my mother everyday. Plus, I'm an introvert person, I'm not good at communicate with strangers too. Luckily, my ex classmate in high school become my roommate so she helped me a lot during that time.</p>
<p>In addition, I'm a thalasemia patient. So I need to see a doctor once every two months for treatment. I was worried at first since I still don't know how to manage it but my friends and lecturer assist me during that time. I was very grateful.</p>
<p>After that, I started to have a good relationship between my classmates. Even I'm not close towards everyone, but at least I have someone that I can talk with. For my first semester, everything run smoothly. I'm having a good time during that semester and also always walk with friends to get know about the area of my university. To be honest, my first semester is a time where I was very active in my students life since I've got very excited.</p>
<p>Actually, having an experienced as university's student is best thing and very useful for me. From an introvert person, now I already got more confidence rather than before. I also get to know more people. Before this, I just spend my time at home and rarely go out to meet people. But after that, I become more happy and confidence to talk with others.</p>

<h2>ABOUT MY UNFORGETTABLE INCIDENT</h2>
<p>When I was 15 years old, I've involved in incident with my cousin. At that time, we were on way to home. Unfortunately, my cousin was careless and crash into a car. The incident happened right in front of Matriculation College at Changlun.</p>
<p>My cousin only having a light injury at hand while me suffered an injury to the left face until it bled and swelled and my left hand is also broken. The owner of the car helped us to called for my parents. </p>
<p>After that, I was sent to the hospital while my cousin went to home. Probably out of shock, I didnâ€™t feel any pain at first. However, after the wound on my face was treated, I began to feel pain. Well, I have never got involve into accident, not even once before.</p>
<p>The most suffering time for me is when the doctor want to fix my broken bones. They did it without giving me anesthesia as the doctor said it was capable of having side effects. During the treatment process, it was the first time I struggled in front of people. It's embrassing and hurt. My other hand was tied to prevent me from moving. </p>
<p> It took about three or four month untill my hand was fully recovered. Until now, I'm having a trauma to ride a motorcycle. My mother still encourage me to overcome it but I think it's scared and hard for me. Maybe because it was my first time having an accident. It was a funny yet sick experience for me that I will remember for the entire of my life.</p>
